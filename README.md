Name: Calvin Chaparro 
Professor:  Mary Walauskis
Course: Software Development I 3024C-14835
CRN: 3024C-14835

Purpose of assignment:
As requested for Module 1 for this assignment, I have uploaded files from a previous project from a prior java class. This is part 1 of that project and it was intended to show the use of generics in a program. Used BlueJ to compile the code.

Function:
Part (1) of the assignment. User runs program via (Main), and is presented 
with interger index, double index and string index with the values provided.
If a value that is not found, a -1 will be thrown. Code is not perfect,
but may be on the right track with the overall parameters of the assignment.
